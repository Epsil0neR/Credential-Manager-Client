In API service always check response code (http status code)
  Check if header Expires is good and ApiKey is known.
  [ ] Provide method to check if response is OK and update local Expires

In Header we will never get ApiKey, but always must come Expires (except single API request: LogOut)

We need to handle all request responses to properly handle errors:
  [ ] Check if ApiKey is still valid (except some requests)
  [ ] Check if request has been handler (HTTP status code = 400)
  [ ] In any case of error properly show error.

API services must get API host from setting in Environment

[ ] Modify globals/settings for environments
[ ] All API urls must be declared in single place
[ ] All API services must use URLs from previous ToDo item.
[ ] All API services before sending request must check ApiKey and if that key is not expired.
